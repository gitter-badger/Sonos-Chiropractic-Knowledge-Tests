Android app of flash cards for aspiring chiropractors. Has a quiz function built in.

Working on making it work with any lolipop device or newer.

Pretty simple. helps you study by giving you the cards,
pulls them out at random in quiz mode, and has you fill in blanks as you get smarter at it
More points means you know more (obviously)

Gives you a score at the end and keeps track of your latest and highest scores.

Hoping to have greater functionality as time goes along
